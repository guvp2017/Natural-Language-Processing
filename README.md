#### Eight homework projects and two term projects
#### Final Project: NLP Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Movie Reviews
Use BeautifulSoup to compile 956 individual user movie review permalinks from IMDb, preprocess and normalize corpus, vectorize with Bag of Words (BoW) or Term-Frequency-Inverse-Document Frequency (TF-IDF), compare K-Means and hierarchical clustering models with Silhouette coefficient, use TextBlob lexicon for sentiment analysis with clusters and chunks, uncover hidden structures with topic modeling (NMF: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, LDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and visualization with pyLDAvis.
